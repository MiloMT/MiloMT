- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Myles!
- Iâ€™m involved in the AEC Sector and interested in the evolution in AEC software and the role that open source has to play.
- Iâ€™m currently learning Python, IFC, C++ and anything programming related that I can get my hands on.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting AEC open source projects that provide benefit to the general community.
